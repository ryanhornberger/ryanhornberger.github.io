title: Something to Say - Ryan Hornberger
---

This year I have decided to do a little learning in the realm of design. As I take lessons over at __[Hack Design](https://hackdesign.org/lessons)__ you should expect to see this site go through several changes.

With the launch of my new site I will also be launching my first blog! To get things up quickly here is a quick article about me.

# Something to Say #

I told myself I’d not write a blog until I had something to say. Well, I finally have something to say.

## The Noise ##

The web is full of noise. There seems to be an endless drone of meaningless messages, hateful speech, and poorly researched opinions. One can waste a life away watching ridiculous cat videos, Vines, and fail compilations. One can go insane reading politically charged articles, conspiracy theories, and other “news.”

On top of that noise you have the advertising noise. Businesses flood your inbox, twitter feed, and newsreaders in feeble attempts to “keep their users engaged.”

I’m so tired of all the noise; I guess that’s why I’m not in marketing!

## My Commitment ##

In an effort to avoid become nothing more than noise, I will __not__ be

* tweeting every day,
* blogging every week,
* filling your inbox with meaningless junk,
* taking pictures of my lunch,
* sending everyone selfies,
* or otherwise attempting to waste your time.

I promise to

* only tweet or blog about something when I really care,
* attempt to stay informed and relevant in my writing,
* and do my best to add value to the lives of my readers.

## About Me ##

I’m a husband, a father, a brother, a son, a friend, a budding activist, and an entrepreneur. I’m not into chasing balls for fun; but I do enjoy traveling, the outdoors, fishing, water skiing, hiking, canyoneering, and a long list of adrenaline inducing activities.

I was also raised LDS (Mormon… learn the vernacular already!), but my friends are discovering that I’m quite a bit more liberal than the average. I’ve never met a man in a position of power who did not abuse it, even if just a little. So I don’t generally take anyone’s word about anything! On those same lines I don’t consider scripture to be the complete, unadulterated word of anyone other than the men who recorded it.

Some days I want to be Atheist, if only to distance myself from “believers” who use their religion to abuse, oppress, judge, and discriminate. I’ve seen so much hate, suffering, fear, and pain caused by “religious conviction,” it makes me sick. On the same note, I’ve met a fair share of people who believe too strongly in their “science.” Waving around the latest “studies” like their own form of scripture and using them to justify the same above abuses. Just wait 50 years and we’ll learn that our research was wrong, manipulated, or shortsighted. We are all the “blind leading the blind.”

I believe a healthy amount of skepticism and doubt is essential to the cause of progress and learning. I also believe in a healthy respect for the unknown, the beyond, and the majesty of our existence. Any excess in any of the above can lead to destructive behavior, but a good balance in life can be so rewarding. My desire to stay balanced is perhaps the biggest reason I remain a believer. If anything, I _want_ to believe in a life after this one. I do not, however, claim to have any special knowledge of exactly how it will all go down or even if it will. In a word, I hope.

## What I plan to write about ##

First, I have a few “causes” I care about. You will be hearing from me soon about how everyone in my family this year is giving up our birthdays for Charity:Water. I also have strong feelings about discrimination, injustice, abuse, and exploitation. I’ll be writing about that as it moves me.

I also intend to write occasional articles about business, work/life balance, fatherhood, technology, marriage, sex, religion, and whatever else is on my mind. I’ll do my best to keep it tasteful and thoughtful. I’ll attempt to avoid just being more “noise”.

This will be an interesting adventure for all of us, welcome to my blog!
