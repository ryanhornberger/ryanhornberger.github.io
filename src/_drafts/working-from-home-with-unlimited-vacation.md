title: Working from home with unlimited vacation
---

I've worked for one year without your normal leash, here is what it was like.

## Too long; didn't read ##

The short of this story is that Scan lets you work from home and does not track vacation hours. We still get our jobs done, we are working our butts off, we are having a great time, and we have the best work-life balance ever. If you know Ruby, we want you at Scan.

## The excitement ##

When Kirk Ouimet (one of the founders of Scan Inc) called me, he already knew he was about to make me an offer i'd struggle to refuse. We were friends in college, he could pay well, the project he wanted me on was awesome, and I was already looking to change jobs. Even with all of that, he knew nothing was going to be as convincing as the bomb he dropped on me when he made me my offer.

Work from home, don't report your time off.

I did not fully understand what challenges would come with such freedom when I received the offer. It was, however, what I thought about every moment after I hung up that phone.

I thought about taking longer lunch breaks, and spending them with one of my children, or my wife. I thought about days when I could work in the evenings and spend the mornings playing with kids. I thought about mid-afternoon breaks to go see my son play Soccer. I thought about working remotely during an extended stay at a lake house. The idea of what was offered to me was thrilling.

## Post traumatic stress ##

The first several months working under these conditions were actually very revealing about my work ethic and history. Every time I needed an extra hour for lunch or needed to shift hours here or there I'd send an email to the team. It was like I had been programmed to make sure someone always knew where I was. The team kept telling me they did not need to know but my brain would not accept it.

The big breaking point for me came after I spent a month at a lake house in Washington State (more on that soon). Once I had returned home I was speaking to Kirk about my trip and he said something that knocked me off my feet. It was something close to

"Honestly, you did not even need to tell us you were going to be out of state. We hardly noticed you were gone."

Now I know this is nothing like the forms of PTSD that someone receives after war, abuse, or other terrible experiences. It's not PTSD at all. That said, I think that I may still have a little bit of denial to this day. How can they be sure I'm working hard? How can I be sure I'm pulling my weight?

Without the strict regiment of the nine-to-five and the logs of accrued and used vacation hours I felt a little lost for a while. I also felt relieved, happy, stress free, and even emotional about the freedom I had been given.

## Distractions ##

The company I came from had been experimenting with something close to an "open floor plan." It was more like cubes without walls. It was by far the most distracting environment I had ever worked in. I'd be trying to code and someone on the other side of the room would toss a toy ball at a team member. My eyes followed the ball every time. Conversations at the furthest corners of the room would be just loud enough to knock me off task. There was nowhere to hide, so when someone needed your help they just walked right up. One of our team members resorted to placing a sign on his desk that read

"If I had a door, it would be closed."

It was a feeble attempt to let people know he was trying to focus; but that did not even stop me when I needed to speak to him. A few months before I decided to look for another job I was asked to represent my department in picking desks for the new building we'd be moving into. The interior designers I met with kept telling me that they knew better. They told me that making the environment "more open" was going to improve employee happiness and the overall look of the room.

I'll agree that an open floor plan has a certain visual appeal, but that's all it's good for. I pleaded with the designers to make sure that our desks had walls that you could not see over even if you were standing. If you want your engineers to stay focused, give them at least two walls each. Specifically to block noise and visual distraction. I left before I ever saw those desks.

## Distractions at home ##

Working from home is a totally different beast. The number one, most important thing I can recommend to anyone is

GET AN OFFICE WITH A LOCKING DOOR!

That was the first thing I did and it's been the only thing thats kept me employed at Scan. If you have a family: working on the couch, in the kitchen, or on your bed is not going to cut it. Think of the office coworkers that wont leave you alone, now imagine that they are 3 years old. That is what it's like working at home. Get an office and when you go to work lock the door. Daddy is at work. That goes for you too mom ;)

The internet becomes your next challenge. YouTube and Wikipedia will kill your day if you let it. I found that setting rules like "entertainment only during lunch hours and after hours" was a good start but it takes a ton of self control. The best solution I found was setting daily goals like "im going to complete feature x before I finish today." If I watch too much YouTube that means I'll be working till midnight. Some days are better than others but my desire to be done by a decent hour helps me avoid distraction.

The worst thing about working from home is when you are at home alone. There is an eerie quiet that comes over the home when the wife and kids are away. It's more distracting than true distractions. I struggle to cope when it's too quiet. Sometimes even music does not help. I'll probably start working at a coffee shop when I expect to be home alone. Just having the simple background noise of people nearby is better than silence.

## Working from a lake house ##

For most of July last year I packed up my computer gear and my family and we stayed at a relatives cabin near a lake in Washington State. It was part vacation, part adventure, and part work. On an average work day my schedule was

  * Code from 9am - noon
  * Take the family to the beach for lunch
  * Code from 1:30pm - 6:30pm
  * Play in the dirt, sit on the deck, watch the sun set.

It has been, by far, the best experience of my employed and family life. I lost 15 lbs in 3 weeks, felt healthier than I had in years, and let go of a ton of stress that I had carried over from my previous job. The weekends were spent riding motorcycles, visiting U-Pick farms, water skiing, going to water parks, and visiting Seattle. If I could convince my wife I'd almost certainly move to that lake forever.

The best part about working at the lake house was that the only internet I had was 4G cellular service tethered through my iPhone. I could not afford to watch YouTube, browse unnecessarily, or use the internet as a distraction. I had 5Gb for the month and I needed most of it for work. I was forced to memorize things about coding that I normally let Google remember. I felt no urges to check social media, and I did not keep my email client open to constantly check for new messages. I coded better than I had coded in years.

## Learning about myself ##

After working from home for a year I've learned a few things about myself.

First, I do my best coding between 12:30pm and 8:00pm. I'm practically useless from 9am - noon when I'm working at home. Oddly, I can't explain why, but I did not have that problem at the lake house. Perhaps the stress of life is more present here than it was at the lake house. My mind gets overly stressed when I first wake up, but after I eat lunch I'm ready to work!

When it comes to coding, some days I can get in a really good groove and work 6-8 hours straight. Other days I struggle to get 4 hours of code in before I burn out. Tuesday seems to be my best day, Monday my worst. If I push myself too hard on one day, the next day is terrible. Finally, my performance is directly tied to how recently I had lunch with friends.

Sometimes I have to work in my beanbag chair, sometimes I need to work standing, sometimes I need to work in a regular chair, and sometimes I can't work at all. I also find that while I am waiting for unit tests to run or just need to think through a problem; those are perfect times to do pull-ups. So I put a pull-up bar 3 feet behind my standing desk. Perhaps in a future article I'll show the world my sweet office setup.

## Success ##

You'd have never thought it could happen, it goes against all the "logic" big business tells us they "know." My products are completed, they are rolling out to the world. I'm adding upgrades, enhancements, and additional features to adjust our target market. I've done field tests, beta releases, and a little bit of sales. I gave Scan one of my best pieces of work yet, and they gave me the best lifestyle I could ever ask for. We all got what we wanted and the world still spins. I took off a grand total of 3 weeks last year and I may take off a little more this year. I feel I stayed honest, and I feel that the company respected me for my needs. I could not be more happily employed.

## Failure ##

This lifestyle is not for everyone. Scan has their own history of employees who just could not stay focused or ended up having family problems from being home too much. You pretty much know if someone is struggling, they stop turning in their work! That's ok, it just did not work out, no hard feelings.

For those that stayed, and even some that have left, this is a group of people that really brings their A-Game. Every person on this team is self-driven, goal oriented, and trustworthy. It would seem that this culture seems to function as a sieve. If you can't keep yourself on task, you fall out on your own.

## Employee retention ##

Two weeks ago, while working a booth to promote my new product at a local business expo, I was approached and offered a job. Their pitch included the words "we have the best benefits." I asked them, "can I work from home and have unlimited vacation time?" Their answer was an expected "no, no we don't offer that." Of course you don't, and thats why I'm not looking for another job. You could not pay me double and only give me two weeks of vacation. I'd never take it.

## Tips ##

We still have a bi-monthly gathering for those of us that are local. Team lunch in the middle of the month and strategy meetings at the beginning. When we need to meet outside of those times we just call each other and either do a Google Hangout or meet in person. We keep a team chat system available and most of us connect to it regularly. Every bit of communication is deliberate, to the point, and necessary. We also have team activities and just get together for lunch whenever we fee like it. I never feel like I don't see enough of my team.

A good support structure at home is vital. If you are single, find a colocated office with other people like yourself. The people you surround yourself with during your work hours need to know when it's ok to interrupt you and when it's not. For me, if the door is locked, I'm busy, if it's not, come on it! Keep your friendships healthy, you need the social interaction. Plan regular lunches, excercise, and/or activities with your friends. Finally, Take Time Off! I constantly find myself with the urge to not plan vacations because I don't want to feel like a slacker. When you've burned out, take some R&R, you'll come back to work more motivated anyway.

## Last thoughts ##

Executives, Managers, HR Departments; guys lets get down to it. Two weeks of vacation is weak and totally destroying your employee job satisfaction. Most people waste those two weeks with sickness and taking care of basic life needs like taxes. Three weeks should be a minimum for any standard job. That extra week is really the week they'd take for vacation, and they need it.
