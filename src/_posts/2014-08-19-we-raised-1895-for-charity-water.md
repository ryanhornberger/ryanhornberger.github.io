This year our son Josh inspired our entire family to give up our birthdays for Charity:Water. We asked for your help and you delivered in such a big way. We raised $1895!

We would like to extend a special thank you to Leslie Rosewaren, Dave Bateman, Garrett Gee, Ritch Sandford, Josh Albrechtsen, Josie Kleinman, Natalie Main, Matthew Taylor, Julie Gillman, and the LDS Timpview 6th Ward. An additional thank you to the other anonymous donors who contributed over $400 to this campaign! You have all made this birthday wish a reality and we've never been more proud of our son.

We cannot wait to see where Charity:Water applies these funds. As soon as we start to receive updates on the project we'll share those updates here. Thank you for helping us bring a bit of hope people in need.
