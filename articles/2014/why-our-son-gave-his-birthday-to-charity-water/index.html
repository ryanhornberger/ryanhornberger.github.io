  <p>This past November our family was in the car when our son Josh called to me from the back seat. Never knowing what to expect when my kids want my attention I braced myself for the upcoming “I’m hungry”, or “are we there yet” complaint. What I got was completely unexpected and it left my wife and I in tears:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Dad, I want to give up my birthday so other kids can have clean water”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Our son Josh is <a href="https://my.charitywater.org/joshs-birthday-water-campaign">giving up his 6th birthday</a>, including all of his presents, to raise funds to help other kids his age gain access to clean water. It might seem crazy to think that a 6yr old kid really wants to give up something so big for such a cause but he made this decision on his own and we could not be more proud. Here is why he did it:</p>

  <h2 id="weve-been-teaching-him-about-world-issues-from-a-young-age">We’ve been teaching him about world issues from a young age</h2>

  <p>Young children, blessed by their youth, often times don’t understand why they can’t have everything they ever wanted. Sometimes they want something else for dinner, or perhaps they’d rather have juice when all we have is water, or maybe they complain about cleaning up their toys, or they complain about helping do dishes. Rather than give our children the usual “kids in Africa are dying to have food like that, so eat it” speech; we take them to the computer.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the wonders of the world wide web we’ve been able to show our kids videos like this one:</p>

<div class="text_block">
  <h2 id="josh-started-asking-questions">Josh started asking questions</h2>

  <p>Shortly after Josh turned four years old his ability to reason became noticably more advanced. His curiosity became insatiable and his questions became increasingly complicated and interesting. Some time before his 5th birthday Josh and I sat together watching a Charity:Water video like the one above. He turned to me and asked me a question. “Dad, do those kids really not have clean water or good food every day?” “Yes Josh, everything I’m showing you is real.” “Dad, if I knew how, I’d send them some clean water.”</p>

  <p>That resulted in a few tears on my part, and then I explained to him that he could do it whenever he wanted. I explained to him that a kid his age could work to raise money for charity, he could donate something he posessed, he could give up a birthday, or he could sell something like lemonaide in the neighborhood.</p>

  <p>Josh gave a solid “hmm, interesting”  </p>

  <h2 id="life-went-on">Life went on</h2>

  <p>Months passed by after that conversation: I changed jobs, we went on a family trip to Washington State, we started his first year in school (Kindergarden), we celebrated Halloween and Thanksgiving, life was normal and even I had mostly forgotten about that conversation over 6 months before.</p>

  <h2 id="something-sparked">Something sparked</h2>

  <p>I don’t know why he was thinking about it, or what caused him to suddenly make up his mind, but that cold afternoon in November when he called out to me from the back of the car will be a memory I’ll keep with me forever. As a father it is my deepest wish that if I can teach my kids anything, it would be to put others before themselves. That is something that even I need to personally work on, but it is my belief that it is the path to finding true meaning in this life. What’s one year of presents if you can exchange that for many more saved lives.</p>

  <h2 id="join-us">Join us</h2>

  <p>Today we’re not asking anyone to give up their birthday with Josh. We are simply asking that you help us make a difference in the life of someone who needs it. Diseases that seem so small to us like diarrhea or simple dehydration are life threating issues for someone who does not have access to clean water. When the water you drink is the same thing that’s making you sick, it surely can’t help you get better. Nearly a billion people on our planet are living without access to clean water. Lets change the world together:</p>
