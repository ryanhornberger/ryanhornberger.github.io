  <p>The number one reason why people say they won’t donate when we talk to them about our campaign is that they can’t trust that their money will be used in a trustworthy manner. That very concern is one of the reasons we love Charity:Water so much. 100% of donations from people like you and me go straight to water projects and none of it is used to fund operational costs. We love Charity:Water because not only do they make that promise, but they also go out of their way to prove it. The work they do is changing the world, read on:</p>

  <h2 id="operation-costs-are-privately-funded">Operation costs are privately funded</h2>

  <p>From the very beginning Charity:Water has kept two bank accounts: one for operational funding, and one for charitable funding. Charity:Water actively works with private donors to fund the operational account. Those donors know what their money is used for and they don’t mind. They even pay for the credit card fees of YOUR donations! <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/100percent/" target="_blank">Learn More…</a></p>

  <h2 id="of-public-donations-all-go-to-water-projects">100% of public donations all go to water projects</h2>

  <p>Public donations go into the second account and 100% of every dollar that goes in that account is tracked and managed to ensure it’s used directly in a water project. Charity:Water even gives every donor a report of where their money went. These reports also include GPS and photo data of the project site. <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/projects/completed-projects/" target="_blank">Take a look at the projects they’ve already completed…</a></p>

  <h2 id="financial-statements-are-public-and-audited">Financial statements are public and audited</h2>

  <p>When that’s not enough you can always browse to the company website and review their yearly reports of cash flow including all of their operational costs. Want more? KPMG recently audited their financial statements and found that indeed, it is their opinion that 100% of public donations did in fact go right where they were meant to.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2 id="they-teach-a-man-to-fish">They “teach a man to fish”</h2>

  <p>Charity:Water believes in helping the beneficiaries of water projects become active participants in the creation and maintenance of their own water source. The local people are asked to help prepare materials for bio sand filters, dig their own hand dug wells, or do whatever else their skill of labor is able to do. Charity:Water helps by providing tools and experts that otherwise don’t exist in the local community. Sometimes that means an entire well drilling rig, perhaps the solution needs a geologist, maybe pumps and piping are needed, and sometimes a project needs something else entirely. Either way, the water project is a joint effort. Charity:Water does not just give people water, they teach them how to keep it coming.</p>

  <p>Once a water project is complete, Charity:Water tries to create a Water Committee among the beneficiaries of the project. General and basic maintenance and repair training is given so that they can keep their project working. When the problem is too big to solve alone, the people are taught how to find help,</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most incredible idea that’s coming out now is that Charity:Water is now adding sensors to many of their pumps so that they can personally monitor the usage and status of a given project. When the water stops flowing Charity:Water can find out immediately and send someone to help. <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/projects/approach/" target="_blank">Learn More…</a></p>

  <h2 id="they-use-local-experts">They use local experts</h2>

  <p>Charity:Water knows they are not capable of managing every project they build on their own. They don’t presume to know the best solutions for every location. That’s why they use local organizations to perform the work. Local organizations know the land, the people, the potential water sources, the potential problems, and the best solutions. So partnering with them is extremely beneficial. </p>

  <p>When local organizations don’t exist or have the resources Charity:Water needs, Charity:Water invests in making local organizations to do the work. Recently Charity:Water held a drive which resulted in placing two new Drilling Rigs in Ethiopia. The people that run those rigs will be locals and they are trained to get the job done right. <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/projects/partners/" target="_blank">Learn More…</a></p>

  <p>Everything I’ve just shared explains why I find Charity:Water to be one of the most trusted charities on my very short list of favorites. However, what first drew me in was listening to their founder Scott Harris talk about why he started the company in the first place. His story is inspring and touching, you should check it out.</p>

  <h2 id="the-work-they-do-really-matters">The work they do really matters</h2>

  <p>I believe that every person in this world matters and every person in this world should have the best chance we can give them to a healthy and productive life. Clean water is one of the most basic of needs and nearly a billion people live without it. </p>

  <h2 id="join-us">Join us</h2>

  <p>Our son Josh is giving up his birthday to raise funds for Charity:Water. He believes that he can make a difference and we believe that together we can make a huge difference. Be a part of our campaign.  </p>
